# Elliptic curve cipher generator
This is a graphical program that uses elliptic curves to generate passwords. The program is designed for different scenarios, through a few simple questions, to generate different strong passwords, so as to ensure the user's password security.

This is also a learning project that I used to teach myself elliptic curve algorithm and graphical programming during the summer vacation.
